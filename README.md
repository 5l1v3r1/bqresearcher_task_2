bqResearcher-Task 2: circuit for producing |00> and |11> with equal probabilities. Parameters are found using gradient descent. Circuit is modified for producing any of the 4 Bell states.

main.py: (all qubits are initially at state |0>)
  1. Circuit for producing |00> and |11> with equal probabilties:
     - A parametric circuit is called that uses only native gates ( http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/apidocs/gates.html?highlight=native#native-gates-for-rigetti-qpus). 
     - A superposition of |0> and |1> is produced by applying RY gate on qubit-1 with angle theta
     - RY gate is applied on qubit-0 with angle pi to produce |1>
     - RY gate is applied on qubit-0 with angle theta (same angle as step (ii))
     - The code uses an instance of a QuantumComputer which then compiles the parametric program to produce an executable that is scanned over for theta using gradient descent.
    
  2. Modification for producing any of the 4 Bell states:
     - An equal superposition of |0> and |1> is produced by applying RY gate on qubit-1 with angle theta = pi/2 
     - RY gate is applied on qubit-0 with angle pi to produce |1>
     - CNOT gate is implemented with qubit-1 as control and qubit-0 as target as follows:
          - Apply RY gate on qubit-0 with angle theta = pi/2
          - Apply CZ gate with qubit-1 as control and qubit-0 as target
          - Apply RY gate in qubit-0 with angle theta = -pi/2
    - Note: The above steps are illustrated for producing the Bell state (|01> + |10>)/sqrt(2). The code produces all of the 4 Bell states by changing thetas and rotating qubit-0 by pi to produce |1> as appropriate.
